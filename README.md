Welcome to **Awesome Workflow Use**! This repository is a community-curated collection of workflow examples and ideas designed to be built and executed with the [**Workflow Use**](https://github.com/browser-use/workflow-use) tool.

[**Workflow Use**](https://github.com/browser-use/workflow-use) is the easiest way to create and execute deterministic browser workflows with variables, which can intelligently fallback to [Browser Use](https://github.com/browser-use/browser-use) (an AI agent) if a step fails. You just _show_ the recorder the workflow, and it automatically generates the underlying automation.

## What's Inside This Repository?

This repository aims to provide a diverse set of conceptual workflows that you can bring to life using the `workflow-use` tool. Instead of fully fleshed-out JSON files (which are best created by recording your specific instance of a website), you'll find a collection of ideas detailing:

* **Name:** A descriptive name for the workflow.
* **Description:** What the workflow aims to achieve.
* **Target Website Category:** The type of websites it applies to (e.g., Social Media, E-commerce).
* **Target Website Examples:** Specific popular websites where this workflow could be used.
* **Core Idea:** The main goal of the automation.
* **Potential Inputs:** What dynamic information the workflow would likely need.
* **Conceptual Steps:** A high-level overview of the actions involved.

You can find these conceptual workflows in the `workflow-use-ideas.json` file in this repository. ALL EXPERIMENTAL.

## Why This Repo? A Little Bit About Me & My Love for `workflow-use` ‚ù§Ô∏è

Hey there! You might be wondering why I put together this "Awesome Workflow Use" collection. Well, it's pretty simple: I'm passionate about contributing to excellent and exceptional open-source projects, and [Workflow Use](https://github.com/browser-use/workflow-use) (and its parent, [Browser Use](https://github.com/browser-use/browser-use)) definitely fits that bill!

I genuinely love the open-source world and the spirit of sharing and building together. There's something incredibly satisfying about "hacking stuff" ‚Äì figuring out how things work, making them better, and creating tools that can help others. And no, I don't live in a hacker house (though that sounds fun!), mainly because my days are joyfully filled with the adventures of raising my one-year-old daughter! She's my primary "thing" these days, in the best way possible. üòä I want to make this world better, using open-source. Maybe someday, she will use my stuff. Who knows!?

I admire the Browser Use team immensely. They are truly exceptional, and I believe they're tackling a fundamentally important challenge for the entire AI and automation industry. The tools they are building, especially `workflow-use,` are absolute game-changers.

As a growth marketer, I see the incredible potential here. The ability to "show" your browser what to do once and then have it reliably repeat those actions, with the intelligence to adapt or fall back to an AI agent when things go sideways, is revolutionary. Honestly, **every marketer (and being honest here, anyone who does repetitive tasks on the web) MUST check out `workflow-use`**. It's poised to save countless hours and unlock new levels of productivity. Their tool is GAME-CHANGING and mostly needs "how-to-use" examples for their growth and expansion. 

They don't need it actually(for marketing), but I also want to expand their growth experiments with growth hacking ideas. Like creating new ready-to-use repos.  

So, this repository is my small way of giving back, sharing ideas, and hopefully inspiring others to explore the power of `workflow-use`. Let's build some awesome automations together!

## Example Conceptual Workflow Structure

Here's a snippet of how a workflow idea is structured in `workflow_ideas.json`:

```json
{
  "name": "Social Media Cross-Platform Post",
  "description": "Post the same update to multiple social media platforms.",
  "target_website_category": "Social Media",
  "target_websites_examples": ["Twitter", "Facebook", "LinkedIn"],
  "core_idea": "Share content across multiple social networks simultaneously.",
  "potential_inputs": ["post_content (string, required)", "image_url (string, optional)"],
  "conceptual_steps": [
    "Login to Platform 1",
    "Compose post with {post_content} and optional {image_url}",
    "Publish post on Platform 1",
    "Login to Platform 2",
    // ... and so on
  ]
}
